## Projects

### Integrating ML with Cloud  
Created recommendation models for CPU/Memory utilization, deployed within the in-house cloud platform, Hydra. The tool evolves into an auto resource optimizer, retraining itself based on user behavior to suggest optimal resource allocation.

### The WireMock Solution  
Developed an in-house solution to replace the CA LISA tool for mocking APIs. This cost-effective tool provides a single point of entry for users to register and use mocks, deployed on Hydra for efficient resource and log management.

### Migrating the Enterprise from Jenkins to GitHub Actions  
Led the migration of AMEX's enterprise CI/CD processes to GitHub Actions. The new solution supports multiple languages and frameworks, simplifying testing workflows and reducing complexity across teams. The migration is ongoing and expected to be fully completed within 6 months.

### Encheres – Auction Site with Ethereum Backend  
Created an auction site backed by Ethereum to maintain the security of the auction backend system. This project utilized blockchain technology to ensure transparent and secure transactions for users.
